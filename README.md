# Memory-Game

This app was made for "Advanced programming 2" class in my university course in C#.Â 
Gole: Find two matching cards on the board. The faster the player does it and the fewer moves he makes, the better.
Depending on the difficulty level, the player can choose a board with the number of cards from e.g. 48 to 120.

General rules of the game: At the beginning of each game you can see which square which cards are on. We try to remember their positions. 
Then the cards will cease to be visible and the player will have to select the fields with the same cards. 
After clicking on the field, the card hidden under it will appear. 
Then we have to indicate the field under which the matching card is located (the player knows, thinks or guesses)

This is how the board with all the cards looks like in WinForms
